dataset = Name of dataset to use. Should exist as a section in config_file.
num_clusters = Number of clusters to use. Either one positive integer value or comma separated list.
deltas = Values of little delta to use. Every value of delta will be run once for every value of num_clusters.
         Can either be single float value or comma separated list.
max_points = Positive integer. If less than number of points in dataset then the dataset will be subsampled
             to this many points.
